# web-dev-starter

Fixed up blog website. Changed the navigation bar, made text wrap around image, displayed images in two column grid on right side.

## Getting Started

Run website with live server

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
